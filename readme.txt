[About](https://comluvplugin.com/ "About") | [Features](https://comluvplugin.com "Features") | [Pricing](https://comluvplugin.com "Pricing")

Now with updated functions to allow you to delete or spam comments where the user has removed their url after getting a last blog post link (helps prevents spammer abuse)

NOTE!

The links that CommentLuv adds are valuable for the people that leave comments so you will need to make sure that spammers do not try to take advantage of your blog by filling it with useless comments just to get a link. Be a good blogger and prevent them from leaving their crap on your site by requiring moderation on first comments and do not accept 'great post thanks!' type of comments.

remember.. if you let anyone comment on your blog without restriction then you WILL get spammed whether you have CommentLuv or not. Be strict with your comment policy and be take responsibility for your own blog by being selective with the comments you accept and the internet will be a happier, spam free and useful place again! :-)

== Installation ==

Wordpress : Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page or visit the plugins page in your dashboard, click 'add new' and search for 'commentluv'

If you're upgrading from an older version, please use the 'reset to default settings' button.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin add any database tables? =

No. The link and associated data is saved to the comment meta table

= My comments form does not show the name and url fields, just the textarea

Make sure you log out of your blog and view the form as a user would. A logged in user does not see the name, email and url fields because your blog already knows them.

= My comment replies are not showing as indented or the thread of the comment is not working

This is entirely down to your theme. Commentluv does nothing to the display of the comments, it just adds the link

= I installed the plugin but I don't see the comment form or the badge shows but commentluv is not working

The plugin only works on wordpress comments systems, it does not work on Disqus or livefyre or jetpack or others. If you are using standard wordpress comments but do not see the form or it is asking you to register then make sure your theme supports comments or you have enabled comments in the settings of your blog or theme

= I am having a problem getting it to work =

Please see the videos in the settings page for explanations of how they work.

= Accents in my language are not showing correctly =

Please tick the box marked "disable UTF8 encoding" in the technical settings area of the plugins settings page
